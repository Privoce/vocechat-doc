# VoceChat Brief

`VoceChat` is a secure chat software that supports independent deployment.
The data is completely controlled by the user.
It supports the whole process of encrypted transmission and can be burned immediately after reading.
The function is inspired by products and specifications such as `Slack`, `Discord`, `RocketChat`, `Matrix` and `Solid`.
VoceChat server is the smallest, stablest and most efficient independent chat server on today's market.

We believe that the way to live up to the true meaning of the decentralization ideal of Web 3.0 is through de-platformization.
Through personalized computing and personalized storage, individuals and organizations can have their own platforms on their own cloud server.
Therefore, Vocechat is created and positioned as a social collaboration program that can be easily deployed on the private cloud by any parties.

The team is internationalized and cooperates remotely.
The contributors come from the United States, China, Brazil and other regions.
The core members include 'MIT' alumni, 'Stanford' entrepreneurial organization members, top Rust developers and open-source veterans.
Vocechat is an open-source product with a free community version and only charges for business usages. You are welcome to star, raise issues, and contribute in any form.
